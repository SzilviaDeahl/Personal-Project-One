Weekly Meal planner

The weekly meal planner app idea came from my very busy life schedule, always on the run, thinking about what should we eat for dinner at home. The app is connected to BigOven's API to be able to search through thousands of recipes after the user types in the ingredient they are looking for.

Features:

-The user is able to login and have an individual profile with previously saved recipes
-The user is able to search by ingredient name
-The user is able to skip a day by selecting Eating Out/Delivery option

Future Features:

-create grocery list
-add/remove items from the grocery list

Used platforms:

-express
-mongo database to store data of users profiles
-Big Oven API
